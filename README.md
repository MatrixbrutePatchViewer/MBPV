# MBPV - The Matrixbrute Patch Viewer

Download the PDF manual (or read online) for more information. Download the zip for installing the application.

The current version will always be mbpv.zip and MatrixbrutePatchViewer_manual.pdf

Requires java 11+. Created and tested on windows. Will probably also work on mac (with more or less adjustments)

The source will (probably) be released sometime later.
